        Your very own <span class="redColor">Youtube Queue</span> has become even better. It is now always active on every youtube tab. Just HOVER over the "youtube queue" bar on the right hand side and the queue manager will show up.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is an icon in top left corner of every video thumbnail. Click on it to add the video to the queue.
        <br>
        <br>
        After adding the videos, you need to click on any one video in the queue to play it and the extension will take it from there.
        <br>

        Rest all is same :)
